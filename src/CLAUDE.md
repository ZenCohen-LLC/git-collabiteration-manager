# Git Collabiteration Manager - Source Code

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Never Modify the media-tool Directory

**The freshbravo/media-tool directory is SACRED and READ-ONLY**
- NEVER make changes directly to /Users/christophergarrison/freshbravo/media-tool  
- This directory should remain 1:1 with what's in git
- ALL changes happen through git worktrees in collabiterations/
- Updates to media-tool come ONLY from git pull
- Changes are contributed back via PRs from iteration branches

## This Directory

This `src/` directory contains the TypeScript implementation of the git-collabiteration-manager:
- `workflows/` - The 4 essential workflows (create, resume, share, remove)
- `claude-flow/` - Claude Flow integration for coordination
- `utils/` - Shared utilities

Follow the patterns established here. Do not create alternatives.
