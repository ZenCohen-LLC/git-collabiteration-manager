# Git Collabiteration Manager - Claude Context

This is a **context-aware git worktree collabiteration management system** built to solve the challenge of managing isolated development environments for feature work while preserving rich project-specific configurations.

## 🚀 Quick Start with Slash Commands

**IMPORTANT: You must be in a project directory (not the git-collabiteration-manager directory) to use these commands.**

### Custom Slash Commands

When you see these commands in a conversation:

#### /iterate
Start a new collabiteration. When you see this command:
1. Check that user is in a project directory (NOT in git-collabiteration-manager)
2. If not, ask them to `cd` to their project directory first
3. Gather requirements for the feature
4. **If the project uses Jira ticket branch naming (e.g., feat/BRAV-1234/description)**, prompt for Jira ticket number
5. Create an iteration plan in `./collabiterations/[iteration-name]/`
6. Guide through setting up an isolated development environment

#### /resume-iteration  
Resume work on an existing iteration. When you see this command:
1. Check for a `collabiterations/` directory relative to current working directory
2. List all subdirectories as available iterations
3. Ask which iteration to resume
4. Load the selected iteration's documentation (ITERATION_PLAN.md or similar)
5. Continue work based on the iteration's current state

Example response:
```
I'll check for available iterations to resume...

Found collabiterations at: ./collabiterations/

Available iterations:
1. custom-pacing (has CUSTOM_PACING_ITERATION_PLAN.md)
2. line-item-types (full project structure)
3. tailwinds-refactor (full project structure)

Which iteration would you like to resume?
```

#### /remove-iteration
Clean up a completed iteration. This removes git worktrees and frees resources.

## 🎯 Purpose & Problem Solved

### The Challenge
Traditional development workflows have limitations when working on multiple features or iterations:

- **Branch switching** requires constant context switching, stashing, and rebuilding
- **Manual worktrees** lack automation and consistent configuration
- **Docker dev environments** are slow and don't integrate well with git workflows
- **Copy-based iterations** create merge conflicts and lose git history
- **One-size-fits-all tools** don't adapt to different project complexities

### The Solution
A **context-aware collabiteration manager** that:
- Automatically detects project structure and applies rich, pre-built configurations
- Uses git worktrees for true isolation with complete project copies
- Provides dedicated databases, ports, and environments per iteration
- Enables seamless PR workflows with rich metadata and automation
- Works universally across any project while preserving project-specific intelligence

## 🧠 Context Intelligence System

### Core Innovation: Project Fingerprinting
The tool analyzes projects using multiple signals:

```typescript
interface ProjectFingerprint {
  gitRemote?: string;           // Repository identification
  packageJson?: object;         // Dependencies and workspace structure  
  dockerCompose?: boolean;      // Infrastructure requirements
  directories: string[];        // Project structure patterns
  frameworks: string[];         // Technology stack detection
  customMarkers: string[];      // Project-specific identifiers
  filePatterns: Record<string, boolean>; // Configuration files
}
```

### Rich Context Preservation
For known projects (like Brkthru Media Tool), the system maintains:
- Complete database setup with migrations and seeding
- Multi-service orchestration (frontend, backend, database)
- Port allocation and environment isolation
- Quality check integration (linting, type checking, testing)
- Custom PR templates with iteration metadata
- Project-specific hooks and automation

### Adaptive Learning
For new projects, the system:
- Detects technology stack and common patterns
- Builds appropriate basic configuration
- Learns and improves context over time
- Saves successful configurations for reuse

## 📚 Lessons Learned

### What Works Well

**1. Context-Aware Approach**
- Auto-detection is far superior to manual configuration
- Rich contexts for complex projects provide massive value
- Adaptive fallbacks ensure universal applicability

**2. Git Worktree Foundation**
- True isolation without virtualization overhead
- Native git integration preserves history and workflows
- IDE compatibility without special configuration

**3. Template-Based Configuration**
- Variable substitution enables flexible, reusable templates
- Project-specific templates capture domain knowledge
- Separation of templates from logic improves maintainability

**4. Deterministic Resource Allocation**
- Hash-based port allocation prevents conflicts reliably
- Consistent naming conventions aid debugging and documentation
- Service dependency resolution enables complex multi-service setups

### Challenges Overcome

**1. TypeScript Module Resolution**
- ES modules vs CommonJS compatibility issues
- Solved with careful tsconfig and package.json configuration
- Import/export consistency across CLI and library code

**2. Git Remote Handling**
- Not all repositories have configured remotes
- Graceful fallbacks for local-only repositories
- Optional remote operations with clear user feedback

**3. Database Schema Isolation**
- Template variable substitution for schema names
- Volume naming conventions to prevent data conflicts
- Migration handling with project-specific tooling

**4. Service Orchestration**
- Dependency resolution between services (database → backend → frontend)
- Health check integration for reliable startup
- Environment variable propagation across services

### Performance Considerations

**1. Context Detection Speed**
- File system operations are cached where possible
- Directory traversal is limited to 2 levels deep
- Package.json parsing is selective for key indicators

**2. Worktree Creation Time**
- Git operations are the primary bottleneck
- Template file generation is optimized for minimal I/O
- Dependency installation is optional and user-controlled

**3. Resource Usage**
- Each iteration requires disk space for complete project copy
- Port allocation is managed to prevent conflicts
- Database resources are isolated but accumulate over time

## 🔧 Implementation Patterns

### Error Handling Strategy
```typescript
// Graceful degradation for missing dependencies
try {
  execSync('git push origin ${branch}', { stdio: 'inherit' });
} catch {
  console.log('⚠️  Could not push to remote (no remote configured?)');
}
```

### Template Variable Substitution
```typescript
// Flexible template system with multiple variable sources
const template = readFileSync(templatePath, 'utf8');
const rendered = template
  .replace(/{iterationName}/g, context.name)
  .replace(/{dbPort}/g, context.database.actualPort.toString())
  .replace(/{frontendPort}/g, context.services.frontend.actualPort.toString());
```

### Context Matching Algorithm
```typescript
// Multi-signal matching with weighted scoring
private isContextMatch(fingerprint: ProjectFingerprint, context: ProjectContext): boolean {
  // 1. Exact git remote match (highest priority)
  // 2. Package.json structure similarity  
  // 3. Custom marker overlap (70% threshold)
  // 4. Directory structure similarity (80% threshold)
  return matchScore > threshold;
}
```

### Service Dependency Resolution
```typescript
// Automatic service startup ordering
const services = Object.entries(context.services)
  .sort((a, b) => (a[1].dependencies?.length || 0) - (b[1].dependencies?.length || 0));
```

## 🚀 Usage Patterns

### Typical Workflow
```bash
# One-time setup per project
git-collabiteration init

# Feature development cycle
git-collabiteration create feature-name --description="What you're building" --ticket="BRAV-1234"
# Or interactively (will prompt for Jira ticket if project uses that convention):
git-collabiteration create feature-name
git-collabiteration start feature-name
# ... develop in isolated environment ...
git-collabiteration share feature-name --title="Feature: Amazing Thing"

# Cleanup after merge
git-collabiteration remove feature-name --force
```

### Advanced Scenarios
```bash
# Multiple parallel iterations
git-collabiteration create feature-a && git-collabiteration create feature-b
git-collabiteration start feature-a  # Ports 3020-3021, DB 5462
git-collabiteration start feature-b  # Ports 3030-3031, DB 5472

# Team collaboration
git checkout iteration/teammate-feature
git-collabiteration start teammate-feature  # Auto-configures their environment

# Cross-project usage
cd /react-app && git-collabiteration init    # Detects React, configures appropriately
cd /node-api && git-collabiteration init     # Detects Node, configures appropriately
cd /media-tool && git-collabiteration init   # Detects media-tool, loads rich context
```

## 🎨 Extensibility

### Adding New Project Types
1. Create context configuration in `contexts/project-name/`
2. Add fingerprint patterns for detection
3. Create templates for environment setup
4. Implement custom hooks for project-specific automation

### Custom Hooks
```typescript
// Example: Post-create hook for custom project setup
export async function setupCustomProject(
  iterationPath: string,
  iterationName: string, 
  context: ProjectContext
): Promise<void> {
  // Custom dependency installation
  // Database initialization
  // Service configuration
  // Development data setup
}
```

### Template Customization
Templates support variable substitution and conditional logic:
- `{iterationName}` - Iteration identifier
- `{dbPort}`, `{frontendPort}`, `{backendPort}` - Allocated ports
- `{dbSchema}` - Database schema name
- `{createdDate}` - ISO timestamp
- Custom variables from project context
